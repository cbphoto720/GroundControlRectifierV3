function checkPose(beta0, icp, GCPX, GCPY, GCPZ)

% This will be a program that you can input camera parameters and GCPS from
% a rectification and do some metrics to see how well the pose is fitting
% the given GCPs.  Note that how well the fit is depends not only on the
% quality of the survey, but also the camera calibration, and how acuratly
% you can find the GPS antenna or GCP target center in an image.
